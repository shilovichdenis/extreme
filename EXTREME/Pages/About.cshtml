                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                    and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
                    leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
                    with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
                    publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
                        readable content of a page
                        when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
                        normal
                        distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look
                        like
                        readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum
                        as
                        their
                        default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in
                        their
                        infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
                        purpose
                        (injected humour and the like).

                        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece
                        of
                        classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
                        Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
                        Latin
                        words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
                        classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
                        1.10.32
                        and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
                        written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
                        Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a
                        line in
                        section 1.10.32.

                        There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have
                        suffered
                        alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even
                        slightly
                        believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there
                        isn't
                        anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the
                        Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator
                        on
                        the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model
                        sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem
                        Ipsum
                        is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
